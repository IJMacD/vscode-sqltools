### 1.1 IJMacD's Easy Connect Syntax

IJMacD's connections handle files so you can use the example below as reference to connect to your DB file:

```json
{
  "name": "IJMacD",
  "dialect": "IJMacD",
  "database": "n/a", // if you use relative paths, the base folder is the currently open folder (or workspace).
  "connectionTimeout": 15
}
```
